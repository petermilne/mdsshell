The "TwuTests" directory.

This directory contains a number of stand-alone java programs.
These programs implement tests on some of the TWU* classes of
jScope, in particular on some of the trickier methods in these
classes.

The test codes should be used stand-alone; they should NOT be 
linked-in with the main jScope code.

The makefile drives the compilation and running of these tests,
but the tests can also easily be run by hand, e.g. as follows:

    javac -sourcepath .. -d . TestTWUFetchOptions.java
    java  TestTWUFetchOptions.java
