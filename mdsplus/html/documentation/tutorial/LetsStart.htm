<p><font face="Arial">So, you have heard about MDSplus, and you are maybe curious to
discover more about this system. You connect to the <a href="http://www.mdsplus.org">www.mdsplus.org</a>
side, download the system, install it and then.... you get lost in the large cornucopia of
tools and libraries. Now, you will surely try to surf the MDSplus documentation in order
to understand which components are useful for what, and you will probably feel a bit
disappointed because you can find detailed descriptions of Application Programming
Interfaces and scripting languages, but no document where a beginner can start working and
understanding the system from scratch.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">This is exactly the purpose of this tutorial, which will describe
all the steps required to set up a data acquisition system (which is, by the way, the
purpose of the MDSplus tool). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We shall start from a very simple application, and then we shall
progressively extend it by adding new components and by learning to use new tools, until
we'll have built a fully fledged data acquisition system and, above all, we'll have learnt
how to use the varoius tools and libraries of MDSplus. Afterwards, you will be confident
enough to look into the technical documentation, use MDSplus for the rapid development of
data acquisition systems and, why not, to contribute to the development of MDSplus with
new ideas and developments.</font></p>
