on different hosts). This mode is not available for either client or server on OpenVMS.</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Numerical node ID.  A long word which uniquely identifies each node in a tree.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>NODE</td>
<td>The basic constituent of MDSplus TREES.  Nodes come in two basic types; CHILDREN, which embody the structure of the tree and MEMBERS which contain data.</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>SUBTREES</td>
<td>MDSplus TREEs which are part of the hierarchy of another tree.  Subtrees are stored as three separate files just like standalone trees.</td>
</tr>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>THIN CLIENT</td>
<td>MDSplus client/server data access model where all expression evaluation, data compression and decompression

<td>An X-windows/motif based tool for exploring and editing MDSplus TREES</td>
