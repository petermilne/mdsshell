<p>MDSplus supports numerous data types, from simple numeric or text types
to composite entities which combine related information into a structure.
Primitive data types include signed and unsigned integers of 1, 2, 4, 8
and 16 bytes; single and double precision floats; single and double precision
complex numbers; and character data. Arrays of these data types with up
to 7 dimensions are supported. Some of the composite data types are used
internally to represent, for example, data acquisition devices or compiled
representations of expressions and data acquisition actions, and are not
ordinarily accessed directly by users. Users will normally be accessing
the primitive data types and several of the composite MDSplus data types
such as SIGNALS, DIMENSIONS, WITH UNITS, WITH ERRORS and RANGES. The datatype
of a given node can be determined by evaluating the expression
<code>GETNCI(node_reference,"characteristic")</code>.

<p>
One of the more important data types provided by MDSplus is the signal.
A signal is a structure which combines a value part, optionally a raw data
part, and one or more dimension descriptions. Data from measurement devices
as well as analysis results are often stored as signals. Many visualization
applications will generate plots of signals by plotting the value portion
versus the dimensions. The value part of a signal can be an expression
which references the raw data part of the signal. Support for transient
recorders often use this feature by storing the raw counts values as the
raw data part and use an expression to convert this raw data to engineering
units (such as voltage) in the value part of the signal. In the case of
the support for a transient record, a representation of the time base would
be stored in the first dimension part of the signal. The components of
a signal can be accessed by evaluating the signal with the TDI functions
DIM_OF, DATA, DATA_WITH_UNITS, RAW_OF.
