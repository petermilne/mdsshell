MDSplus is a set of software tools for data acquisition and storage 
and a methodology for management of complex
scientific data.
</p>

<p>
MDSplus allows all data from an experiment or
simulation code to be stored into a single,
self-descriptive, hierarchical structure. The
system was designed to enable users to easily
construct complete and coherent data sets.
</p>

<p>
The MDSplus programming interface contains only a
few basic commands, simplifyng access even
into complicated data structures. Using the client/server
model, data at remote sites can be read or written
without file transfers. MDSplus includes x-windows
and java tools for viewing data or for modifying
or viewing the underlying structures.
</p>

<p>
Developed jointly by the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, the Center for Nuclear Resarch
(Padua, Italy), and the Los Alamos National Lab,
MDSplus is the most widely used system for data
management in the magnetic fusion energy
program. It is currently installed at over 30
sites spread over 4 continents.
