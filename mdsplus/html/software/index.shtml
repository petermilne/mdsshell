<p>To download a copy of MDSplus click on the "Downloads" link on the left. You will be asked to
fill out a short form which will help us keep track of how MDSplus is being used. Currently you 
will need to go through this process for each package that you wish to download. For the linux
platform we have included OpenMotif kits which the MDSplus Motif applications are linked 
against. You may need to use the --force option of rpm to install the OpenMotif kit if you
already have another OpenMotif kit installed.<p>If you want to install the Globus enabled kits
then you also need to install the <a href="http://www.globus.org/">Globus libraries </a> compatible
with these kits. For additional instruction on installing the Globus enabled kits you should visit
the <a href="http://w3.pppl.gov/transp/ComputeServerAccess.html">PPPL TRANSP pages </a>
which have been created as part of the <a href="http://www.fusiongrid.org/">
National Fusion Collaboratory project.</a><p>
The MDSplus user community has also developed some MDSplus extensions which may be generally useful
to other MDSplus users. As the number of these extensions grow we hope to provide a mechanism for
users to advertise their packages and provide instructions for downloading, installing and using
them. For now we will add url links on the "Shared Apps" page. If you have an application, utility,
language interface or any other useful tool that you would like to share with the MDSplus user
community and can provide a url to your tool please send an email to <a href="mailto:webmaster@mdsplus.org">
webmaster@mdsplus.org</a>.
<p>
The MDSplus source code cvs repository can be from your browser by clicking <a href="/cgi-bin/MDSplusCVS">here</a> or downloaded using cvs as follows:
<pre>
   # cvs -d :pserver:MDSguest@www.mdsplus.org:/mdsplus/repos login
   CVS password: MDSguest
   # cvs -d :pserver:MDSguest@www.mdsplus.org:/mdsplus/repos checkout mdsplus
</pre>
