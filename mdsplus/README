Welcome to the MDSplus CVS Distribution. The MDSplus system was first designed
to provide data acquisition services for the C-Mod experiment at MIT, the RFX
experiment in Padova, Italy and the ZTH experiment at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory. Development of MDSplus began in 1987 by the initial development
team of:

Tom Fredian - MIT
Josh Stillerman - MIT
Giulio Flor - Padova
Gabriele Manduchi - Padova
Ken Klare - LANL

The system was first developed for the OpenVMS platform. In the mid 1990's a
client access package was developed which allowed users on unix and windows
systems to access MDSplus data via a server on OpenVMS. In the 1998 an porting
effort was begun to port the entirety of MDSplus to the unix and windows
platforms. The porting team consisted of:

Tom Fredian - MIT
Josh Stillerman - MIT
Tom Gibney - PPPL
Jeff Schachter - GA
Bill Meyers - LLNL

Also beginning in 1997 several java class libraries and applications have been
developed to access the MDSplus system. Most of this work has been done by
Gabriele Manduchi and his colleagues in Padua.

As more and more sites install and utilize the MDSplus system it is hoped that
the number of contributors to this package will grow.
